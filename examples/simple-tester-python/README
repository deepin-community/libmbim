The simple-tester-python program makes use of the 'libmbim-glib' library
through GObject Introspection.

The program will:
 * Open a connection to the mbim-proxy, or launch the mbim-proxy itself
   if it isn't already running.
 * Query device capabilities

The output will look like this:

$ ./simple-tester-python /dev/cdc-wdm0
device type:          embedded
cellular class:       gsm
voice class:          no-voice
sim class:            removable
data class:           gprs, edge, umts, hsdpa, hsupa, lte
sms capabilities:     pdu-receive, pdu-send
control capabilities: reg-manual
max sessions:         8
custom data class:    None
device id:            013937003110648
firmware info:        FIH7160_V1.1_MODEM_01.1349.12
hardware info:        XMM7160_V1.1_MBIM_GNSS_NAND_RE

Note that the program requires libmbim-glib to be installed in the system
and the introspection typelibs available in the standard paths.

Have fun!
